# **FILMY**
- ## Project Idea
A ReactJS and NodeJS project where we built a Movies App.

The main point of our project is to find movies/series, read about the storylines, see the cast lists, see advertisements for movies/series, ratings, and other information about movies/series. We have used NodeJS for the backend, where we saved the users' information on the mongoDB that contains the email, name, password. Also, we used the ReactJS for Frontend, we set the multi-language option, so that the user will be able to choose a language from three languages, which are English, Arabic or Hebrew. This option can only be applied to the application interface. As for the movie information, it will be displayed in English only because it is fetched from the API, so we can’t change the language in it because of the method we used. There is a dark light mode so that the user can choose the colors that they are most comfortable with. This project contains a login page, a register page and a password change page. The homepage displays the five most famous (top) movies ,the section below is divided into categories, whether it is movies or TV series, and you can see all the information and details and search for the movie or series that you’re interested in.
